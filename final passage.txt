The proper application bioinformatics components involves evaluating data interpreting results biologically relevant manner , data next-generation DNA sequencing , protein sequencing , RNA sequencing ( RNA-Seq ) , gene expression profiles , metabolic pathways , molecular markers . The widely used software/tools large biological data include , Strand NGS , CLC Genomics Workbench , Lasergene Genomics Suite , NextGENe , Partek Genomics Suite , Genomatix , FreeBayes , Nanopore , GenomeComb , SIFT , PANTHER , Genome Track Analyzer , etc . Strand NGS integrated platform provides tools analyzing , managing , visualizing next-generation sequencing data ( https : //www.strand-ngs.com/fea tures ) . In addition supporting RNA-Seq DNA-Seq workflows [ 11 ] , supports microRNA-Seq protocols [ 12 ] well protocols , variant calling [ 13 ] . The CLC Genomics Workbench ( QIAGEN ) provides comprehensive analysis package analyzing visualizing NGS data . Additionally , includes sequence analysis tools CLC Main Workbench . Several studies reported use CLC genomics workbench NGS data analysis including de novo assembly RNA-Seq data analysis [ 14 ] , mitochondrial DNA analysis [ 15 ] , etc . All bioinformatics tools mentioned used many researchers high throughput analysis whole genome sequencing , transcriptome analysis , metagenomics , metabarcoding data [ 16â€ “ 18 ] . Bioinformatics software sequencing technologies transformed biomedical research aquaculture fisheries sectors address aquaculture fisheries issues . NGS technology bioinformatics tools becoming increasingly affordable . On hand , gathering tremendous amount genome data form millions billions short reads , annotating genome , identifying nucleotide variations , classifying RNA molecules , identifying molecular markers specific genome , among things , remains problematic . Fortunately , advance bioinformatics , several new software tools available researchers tackle issues aquaculture . Several applications bioinformatics aquaculture given Fig . 2 .
